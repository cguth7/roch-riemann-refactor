# Cycle Focus (Active Edge)

This mirrors the ledger archive style: one active edge per cycle.
Keep it short; update once per cycle.

## Active Edge (pick ONE)
- Lemma/Goal:
- File:
- Why now:
- Proof skeleton (3 steps max):
  1)
  2)
  3)
- Done when (concrete):
- Stop if (red flag):

## Next Edges (max 2)
- 
- 

## Blocked/Deferred (max 3)
- 
- 
- 

## End-of-Cycle Checks
- rg axioms/sorries (only if claims changed)
- short SESSION_LOG entry
