# Agents (DEPRECATED)

This folder contains experimental multi-agent orchestration designs that are **no longer in use**.

These files document an early exploration of using multiple specialized agents (orchestrator, generator, curator, reflector) to coordinate proof development. The approach was superseded by simpler single-agent workflows with the Lean 4 theorem proving skills.

## Contents

- `orchestrator.md` - Main coordinator agent spec
- `generator.md` - Proof generation agent spec
- `curator.md` - Code quality agent spec
- `reflector.md` - Self-reflection agent spec

## Status

**Deprecated as of Cycle 241.** Retained for historical reference only.

For current methodology, see `state/playbook.md`.
