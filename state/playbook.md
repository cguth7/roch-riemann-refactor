# Playbook (Curator maintained)

- Prefer line-bundle / invertible-sheaf RR statements; divisor RR is a wrapper.
- Use `finrank k` for dimensions; avoid `Nat`-based dims until the end.
- Keep lemma statements small: fewer binders, fewer coercions, fewer implicit arguments.
- When stuck on coercions, introduce explicit `let` bindings for objects (e.g. `L : LineBundle X`).
