# Full Adele Ring with Infinite Place

This file defines the full adele ring as a product of the finite adele ring and the
completion at infinity. This resolves the mathematical obstruction discovered in Cycle 121:
K is NOT discrete in the finite adeles, but IS discrete in the full adeles.

## Mathematical Background

For a function field K = Fq(t) over a finite field Fq:
- The finite adele ring A_f uses only finite places (HeightOneSpectrum primes)
- K is NOT discrete in A_f (every neighborhood of 0 contains infinitely many k ∈ K)
- The full adele ring A = A_f × K_∞ includes the infinite place
- K IS discrete in A (the product formula constrains elements at all places)

## Main Definitions

* `FullAdeleRing R K K_infty` - Product of FiniteAdeleRing and completion at infinity
* `fullDiagonalEmbedding` - Diagonal embedding K → FullAdeleRing
* `FullDiscreteCocompactEmbedding` - K is discrete and cocompact in full adeles

## For Polynomial Fq / RatFunc(Fq)

We use Mathlib's `FqtInfty Fq` (completion at infinity via `inftyValuation`) as K_∞.
This gives:
- `FullAdeleRing (Polynomial Fq) (RatFunc Fq) (FqtInfty Fq)`
- K is discrete in full adeles (provable)
- Cocompact fundamental domain (with class group considerations)

This is the corrected version of DiscreteCocompactEmbedding. Unlike the finite adele
version (which is FALSE), this statement is TRUE for function fields when K_∞ is the
completion at infinity.

Key difference from finite adeles:
- In finite adeles: neighborhoods constrain only finitely many places
- In full adeles: neighborhoods constrain all places including infinity
- The product formula ∏_v |x|_v = 1 enforces discreteness when all places are included

/-! ## Concrete Instance: Polynomial Fq / RatFunc(Fq)

For function fields, we would use Mathlib's `FqtInfty Fq` as the completion at infinity.
This is the completion of `RatFunc Fq` with respect to `inftyValuation`.

**Status**: The concrete instance requires careful navigation of Mathlib's completion API:
- `FunctionField.FqtInfty Fq` is the completion type
- The `Algebra (RatFunc Fq) (FqtInfty Fq)` instance comes from `UniformSpace.Completion`
- The valuation on completion elements uses `Valued.v` (not `inftyValuation` directly)

This will be instantiated in a future cycle once the API is better understood.

/-! ### Why K IS discrete in full adeles

The key difference from finite adeles:

**Finite adeles (K NOT discrete)**:
- Neighborhoods of 0 constrain finitely many finite places
- For any finite set S of primes, the ideal ∏_{p∈S} p contains infinitely many polynomials
- Hence K ∩ U is infinite for every neighborhood U

**Full adeles (K IS discrete)**:
- Neighborhoods constrain all places including infinity
- For k ∈ K nonzero: ∏_v |k|_v = 1 (product formula)
- If |k|_p ≤ 1 for all finite p, then |k|_∞ ≥ 1 (forced by product formula)
- Conversely, if |k|_∞ < ε for small ε, then |k|_p > 1 for some finite p
- This extra constraint from infinity makes K discrete

**Mathematical proof sketch**:
1. Take neighborhood U = U_f × U_∞ where:
   - U_f constrains finitely many finite places (val ≥ 1)
   - U_∞ constrains infinity (val ≥ N for large N)
2. For k ∈ K with diagonal(k) ∈ U:
   - |k|_p ≤ 1 for almost all finite p (finitely many exceptions bounded by U_f)
   - |k|_∞ ≤ ε for small ε (from U_∞)
3. Product formula: if all |k|_v ≤ 1 and |k|_∞ ≤ ε, then |k|_v = 1 a.a. and k bounded
4. Only finitely many k ∈ K satisfy these bounds (Riemann-Roch!)
5. Hence K ∩ U is finite, making K discrete.

/-! ## Concrete Instance: Polynomial Fq / RatFunc(Fq) / FqtInfty

For function fields over finite fields, we instantiate the full adeles using:
- R = Polynomial Fq (the integer ring)
- K = RatFunc Fq (the fraction field / function field)
- K_∞ = FqtInfty Fq (completion at infinity)

Proof sketch: If k = p/q with gcd(p,q) = 1, and |k|_v ≤ 1 for all finite v, then q has

/-! ## Summary

This file provides the corrected adelic framework:

### Completed (sorry-free, general definitions)
- `FullAdeleRing R K K_infty` definition as product
- `fullDiagonalEmbedding` into full adeles
- `FullDiscreteCocompactEmbedding` class (corrected axioms)
- `fullDiagonalEmbedding_injective` theorem

### Concrete Instance: Fq[X] / RatFunc Fq / FqtInfty (with sorries)
- `FqFullAdeleRing Fq` type alias
- `inftyEmbedding` : RatFunc Fq →+* FqtInfty Fq
- `fqFullDiagonalEmbedding` into full adeles
- `integralFullAdeles` using Valued.v
- `instFullDiscreteCocompactEmbedding` instance (sorries in proofs)

### Key Insight
The infinite place provides the "missing constraint" that makes K discrete.
- In finite adeles: neighborhoods constrain only finitely many places → K NOT discrete
- In full adeles: |k|_∞ = q^{deg k} constrains degree → K IS discrete
